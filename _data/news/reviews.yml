    There is a huge gap between a good CS education and what is considered
    "common knowledge" in start-up engineering teams. Most of us had to learn
    this stuff through blogs, coworkers, and, of course, the school of hard
    knocks. But <em>Hello, Startup</em> finally collects a lot of this wisdom
    into one place. I wish I'd had a book like this when I was getting my start
    in the industry.

    Jim will give you a guided and well-informed look at what it takes to build
    a software startup. There is no jargon or fluff&mdash;just practical,
    simple, and proven advice, presented in an easily readable book. If youâ€™ve
    ever wondered, "How do I come up with startup ideas?" or "What technology
    should I use for this project?" or "How do I get awesome startups to hire
    me?" then <em>Hello, Startup</em> is for you.

    As a startup founder, you are expected to learn an unbelievable amount of
    knowledge from an incredibly diverse set of disciplines in a very short
    period of time. While I treasure the experience of beating my head against
    the wall and eventually figuring things out, I wish I had this guide when I
    first got started.

    Like Jim, I started my career working for big, established companies. I'm
    now the co-founder of my own company, prismic.io, and this experience is
    teaching me a lot every single day. This book captures a lot of these
    learnings and explains not only how, but also why a startup can be a great
    way to unleash your true potential.

   If every computer science department gave out this book as a graduation gift,
   two good things would happen across the tech industry. The worst tech
   companies would go out of business, and the good ones would become
   dramatically more productive.
