          A performance analysis methodology is a procedure that you can follow 
          to analyze system or application performance. These generally provide 
          a starting point and then guidance to root cause, or causes.

          The USE Method provides a strategy for performing a complete check of 
          system health, identifying common bottlenecks and errors. For each 
          system resource, metrics for utilization, saturation and errors are 
          identified and checked.
